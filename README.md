# LLL (Lazy Linux Loader)
A very simple Linux bootloader for legacy BIOS that boots only Linux.

Currently in a very very very very early stage, so not all features advertised are actually here until an alpha, beta, or final release.

## Features (currently supports none of these)
* Only boots Linux.
* Boots Linux from a FAT32 partition.
* Supports MBR and GPT.
* No fancy features like menus and stuff.
